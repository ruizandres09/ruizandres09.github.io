<!-- PSUEDO_CODE 
1.I would have to create an event listener to capture the user key input. 
2. Then i would have to store that key input and compare it to the an array of letters representing the alphabet 
3. I would have to create a variable that represents the cumputer guess, that variable would be assigned to a randomly generated number that represents the index of the alphabet array.
4.Then i would have a for loop that would run continuously comparing the user input key value to the "computer guess" variable.
5.then i would have to create variables to represent the values of : Wins, loses,guesses left.
6.Iin the for loop would have to increase the number of wins if the, loses
7. I would also have display the array of letters that the user has already input.
