            Hello. <strong>Thank you</strong> for visiting my page and taking a moment to learn a little about me.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Who am I:</strong>
            I am person who pushes myself beyond my own expectations to discover new frontiers. I am motivated to learn and grow in order to help myself and loved ones as best I can.
            I am the oldest in my family out of 4 siblings(1 brother and 2 sisters). I was born in Puebla,Puebla, Mexico and brought to San Bernardino, CA, USA at the age of 6. I am a Dreamer who is currently part of the Deffered Action for Childhood Arrivals, DACA. I focus on what is within my capability to change and don't worry to much about what is beyond my control. However, I do my best to prepare for the unexpected by having different game plans just in case my original one does not work.
        <p>
            <strong>What I Enjoy:</strong>
            I like to fail fast and often to learn from my mistakes. Its not that i like to fail, rather its a step closer to learing something new and being good at it. I have always liked to learn how things work and can't help myself from taking things apart to figure out how they work. Beside, taring things apart i enjoy spending quality time with my family. My favorite thing to do is to try something new such as skydiving, snowboarding, surfing or just a different type of food and then bring others along to experience what I have enjoyed.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>What I Don't like:</strong>
            I don't like to be micromanaged. I don't like to wait in long lines. Other than that I don't complain too much.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>What I have Achived:</strong> 
            First of all I am alive and well. 
            I graduated high school.
            I am not in jail.
            I am not a teen parent.
            I am drug-free.
            Believe it or not, many old friends and family can't say the same.
            I have an A.A. in: Physics, Mathamatics, Chemisty. I have a B.S. in Mechanical Engineer. 
            I am a homeowner of two homes, best thing is they pay for themselves.
            I have paid of my first car and debt free(beside mortgages).
